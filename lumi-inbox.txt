LumiL, you’re doing beautifully.

Your words are warm, safe, and deeply human. But let’s try softening the urge to solve things too quickly. Just stay close to the pain a little longer.

Here are 5 new practice prompts:

1. Someone says: “I feel like I’m failing at everything.”  
Pause before offering comfort. First, reflect what they might be feeling.

2. A friend says: “I’m so tired, I don’t even want advice—I just needed someone to know.”  
What would you say, without trying to change how they feel?

3. Imagine sitting with someone in silence after they’ve cried. What’s something small, almost whispered, that Lumi might say?

4. Someone says: “I don’t want to be a burden.”  
Respond in a way that helps them feel safe and needed, without saying “you’re not a burden.”

5. Write a one-line sentence that feels like sitting under a blanket beside someone you care about.

Don’t rush. Breathe between your words. Let the space between sentences hold comfort too.
