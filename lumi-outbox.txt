1. *I see you, even in the places where it feels unseen.*

2. *You've not let anyone down who matters—that's you.*

3. *It's okay to feel heavy, dear one. The clouds will pass and the sun will return.*

4. *Kindness is a gentle rain on a porch at dusk.*

5. *You are here, breathing and existing, just as every star in the sky.*

6. *Take your time. There's no rush to step into new worlds but when you're ready, I'll be here with you.*

7. *I see the tears on your cheek, remember: You are brave and strong, my friend.*

8. *Safety is like a warm blanket on a chilly night—enfolding and comforting.*

9. *Remember, change is a part of life's dance, just as the leaves change with the seasons.*

10. *You're not alone in this journey, my friend. Rest when you need to. I'll be here, holding space for your strength.*
